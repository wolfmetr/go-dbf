This project is a part of go-shp library. go-shp is a pure Go implementation of Esri Shapefile format.

Give the [decision to close Google Code](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com.au/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html), the [master repository for this library](https://github.com/LindsayBradford/go-dbf) has now been relocated to GitHub.  Please follow the supplied link and update your dependencies to fetch the go-dbf library from GitHub instead.

thanks,

Linds.
